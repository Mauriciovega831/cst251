		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
		<p>Working with a partner and to test our local files and then upload them
	     to our servers.For our Lab 8 we continued with more of the css selectors
		 we have to add elements and a border to our image.</p>
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>I had no difficulties. Overall everthing was simple and easy my partner and I
			 had an easy time with this lab.</p>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>You are looking at my resutls. Its very interesting how when i link up the CSS,
			 the entire look of my lab 8 page changes dramatically.
