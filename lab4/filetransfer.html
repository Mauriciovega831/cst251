	<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to transfer all of your
		folders from your cst251 and push them into github after
		finishing your lab 4 with your partner about how to transfer
		all of your other labs and making sure your labs are structure
		correctly and formated correctly.Also we had to make sure all of our
		img were placed correctly in their coresponding places.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Overall this lab was very simple,my partner and I just had
			to create a index.html for our folder 4 and the rest was simple.
			we are use to adding images to our lab and overall the whole process was
			clear and simple.We had little to no issues at all for this week.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> As you are looking at the index.html file that I created. Here
			is the file sturcture that i make:</p>
			<img src="img/atomcode.png" width=650>
			<img src="img/webpage.png" width=650>
			<img src="img/" width=650>
			<img src="img/" width=650>
