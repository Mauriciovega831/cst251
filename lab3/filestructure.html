	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to futher create a local file
		structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the Challenges
		of it, but I had some difficulty creating index.html files and
		making them work right.</p>
	<h2> Results</h2>
	<p> Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here
		is the file structure that i made:</p>
	<img src="img/file-structure.png" width=650>
	<img src="img/bio-code.png" width=650>
	<img src="img/finished bio-code.png" width=650>
	<img src="img/screenshot-bio.png" width=650>
