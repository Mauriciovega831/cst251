		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
		<p>We had a lot of difficulties with this lab in general. We asked our partners from our group
			to see if they had any ideas on how we should code our css, they were also
			stuck but after several hours of messing around with the code we figured out how to make the sidebar sticky.</p>
