	<h1>Lab 5 More html</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to create a new lab in the lab5 folders
		and write about the challenges about this weeks lab and to add images
		and overall to add a couple of websites that link to our lab 5 index
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Overall this weeks lab was very simple, my partner and I just
			to create a new index.html for lab 5 and the rest was simple. We are use
			to adding images to our lab and then adding a link to an image and after
			adding a couple websites links after but overall this weeks lab was
			clear and simple.
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> As you are looking at my index.html that i created it shows how the
			images display and how the links work in my lab5.</p>
